This was a project for school (CNM).

The project goal was to build a t-shirt order form website, that utilized:

- html and minor css to build a form table.
- javascript to validate the form data.
- php to parse and enter data to a database.

The project is kept locally on my machine using XAMPP with mariaDB.
